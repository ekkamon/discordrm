# DiscordRM

I started this project to learn about new technologies and stacks that I had never used before.
I just cloned the UI/UX from Discord and did not redesign anything. So you don't have to expect it to actually work.

‼️ This project use for educational purposes only. ‼️

# Stacks & Tools

- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Go (Fiber)
- Next.js (Typescript)
- Sass
- Docker

Stacks & Tools might be updated more in the future...
